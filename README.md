# SumColumnPlugin
Plugin for Calibre to sum up numerical columns

A quite simple plugin. In the configuration dialog all user defined calibre columns of a numerical type are presented.
The user can select which of them to be summed up.

When the plugin is executed, the configured columns of all selected books are summed up. The result is shown as an info
dialog and in the Calibre status bar.
